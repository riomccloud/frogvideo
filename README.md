# FrogVideo
Small bash and batch script that redirects video streams to VLC media player.

## About
FrogVideo is a bash and batch script that uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to extract media streams from given URLs and launch VLC media player reproducing these streams. Other great media players like mpv, SMPlayer and MPC-HC already support yt-dlp by default, and do not need this script.

### Features
* Play videos with separate audio track in different URL
* Redirect URLs from the web browser to the script automatically¹
* Runs locally on the machine
* Small and lightweight
* Support all websites yt-dlp supports ([check here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md))
* Support custom video resolutions²

**¹** requires optional configuration\
**²** requires website support
